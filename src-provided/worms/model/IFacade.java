/**
 * Implement this interface to connect your code to the user interface.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>For separating the code that you wrote from the code that was provided to you,
 * put <b>your code in the <code>src</code> folder.</b>
 * The code that is provided to you stays in the <code>src-provided</code> folder.
 * If you modify the provided code, it's advised to move the modified code to the <code>src</code> folder as well,
 * so that your changes are not accidentally overwritten by an update.
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>You should at least add the following classes to the package <code>worms.model</code>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a class <code>World</code> for representing the world</li>
 * <li>a class <code>Worm</code> for representing a worm</li>
 * <li>a class <code>Food</code> for representing a food ration</li>
 * <li>a class <code>Projectile</code> for representing a projectile</li>
 * <li>a class <code>Facade</code> that implements this interface (<code>IFacade</code>).</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <li>
 *  The header of that Facade class should look as follows:<br>
 * <code>class Facade implements IFacade { ... }</code><br>
 *  Consult the <a href=
 * "http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html">
 * Java tutorial</a> for more information on interfaces, if necessary.
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>Each method defined in the interface <code>IFacade</code> must be
 * implemented by the class <code>Facade</code>. For example, the implementation
 * of <code>getX</code> should call a method of the given <code>worm</code> to
 * retrieve its x-coordinate.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Methods in this interface are allowed to throw only
 * <code>ModelException</code>. No other exception types are allowed. This
 * exception can be thrown only if calling a method of your <code>Worm</code>
 * class with the given parameters would violate a precondition or if the method
 * of your <code>Worm</code> class throws an exception (if so, wrap the
 * exception in a <code>ModelException</code>). <b>ModelException should not be
 * used anywhere outside of your Facade implementation.</b></li>
 * 
 * <li>The rules described above and the documentation described below for each
 * method apply only to the class implementing IFacade. Your class for
 * representing worms should follow the rules described in the assignment.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Do not modify the signatures of the methods defined in this interface.
 * You can however add additional methods, as long as these additional methods
 * do not overload the existing ones. Each additional method must be implemented
 * in your class <code>Facade</code>.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Your <code>Facade</code> class should offer a default constructor.</li>
 * </ul>
